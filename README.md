We intend to gather 200 images per each Old Babylonian cuneiform character. The target character types are most frequently appeared 100 ones in several corpora.
Though the construction of this images is undergoing now, we've already almost fully collected the images for some character types.

Images for a character are contained under the directory named character class, e.g. A, AN, E2.
